title: About this site


## Open APC

The [Open APC initiative](http://intact-project.org/openapc) releases datasets on fees paid for open access journal articles by universities and research insitutions under an open database license.
Open APC, which is also supported by the DINI Working Group Electronic Publishing, is located at [Bielefeld University Library](http://www.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/english/).
Since October 2015 Open APC ist part of the [INTACT](http://intact-project.org) project.

## Data Access
   
Main place for Open APC to collect and maintain its data is [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenAPC), where the core data file is kept and redacted in CSV format.
This site and its open [backend](http://129.70.40.89:3000) were established to improve accessibility and re-use of the data, which means that there are 3 ways to access the Open APC dataset, differing in their tradeoff between flexibility and ease of handling:

* Raw data

    The most basic way to access the Open APC data is the [main APC file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/master/data/apc_de.csv) on GitHub.
    It is a [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file, meaning that it should be easily processable by a wide range of tools and programming languages.
    A schema description of the file can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/wiki/schema). 

* OLAP

    Since the raw CSV data can be difficult to analyze without tool support, a more elegant method is querying the Open APC [OLAP Server](http://olap.intact-project.org).
    This service implements an [online analytical processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing) framework based on [cubes](http://cubes.databrewery.org/), forming the backend of data.intact-project.org.

    Some example queries:

    <http://129.70.40.89:3000/cube/openapc/aggregate?drilldown=publisher&cut=period:2014>

    *(How much did every individual publisher receive in 2014?)*

    <http://129.70.40.89:3000/cube/openapc/aggregate?drilldown=journal_full_title&cut=institution:Bielefeld U>

    *(What journals did Bielefeld University pay for?)*

    <http://129.70.40.89:3000/cube/openapc/aggregate?drilldown=journal_full_title|doi&cut=institution:Regensburg U|period:2013>

    *(List journal title and DOI of every article Regensburg University paid for in 2013)*

    **Note**: The query return format is JSON. If you want to view the results directly in your browser, it is highly advisable to use an addon or extension or that properly formats JSON, like [JSONView](http://jsonview.com) for Firefox.

* Treemaps

    The treemaps on this site present the most easy and intutitive way to browse and inspect the Open APC data. It is possible to either view the data for single institutions or the [whole data set](/apcdata/openapc/).
